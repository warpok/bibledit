From my e-mail:
I was surprised that my team member (who is marked as a translator) had the icon for sending the desktop.
So I sent four desktops that I had created for our team back to myself.

It seems to me that a translator (logged into the cloud program) should not be able to send a desktop to the whole translator group.
